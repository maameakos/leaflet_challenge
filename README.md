# leaflet_challenge
The Earthquake Visualization Project leverages Leaflet to create an interactive map that visualizes earthquake data sourced from the USGS GeoJSON feed. The map plots earthquake locations with markers that vary in size and color according to the earthquake's magnitude and depth, respectively. Each marker includes a popup that displays additional details about the earthquake, such as its location, magnitude, and depth. A legend is provided to clarify the color coding used for earthquake depths, and country and continent names are displayed on the map for better geographical context. This project provides a dynamic and informative way to explore recent earthquake activity globally.
